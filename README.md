# About me
I'm an experienced data engineer and [Microsoft Data Platform MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5004052). I specialise in building and automating analytics platforms using Microsoft technologies from the SQL Server stack to the Azure cloud. I’m a fervent advocate of [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps), with a technical focus on bringing automation to both analytics development and operations. An active member of the data community and keen knowledge-sharer, I'm a volunteer, organiser, speaker, blogger, open-source contributor and author – my book *Azure Data Factory by Example* will be published by Apress in 2021. I hold a [PhD in Computer Science](https://etheses.bham.ac.uk/id/eprint/213/) and participate enthusiastically in choral singing, craft ale and cocktails, most successfully in that order.
